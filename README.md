# Pokedex
This is a simple javascript app that uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to pull the name, types, stats, and sprite of a Pokemon. 

It gives this info on the first 150 Pokemon and displays them as a list of names. When a name is clicked, a modal shows the additional info for a Pokemon.

There is also the ability to filter Pokemon by name with a search box at the top of the page.
